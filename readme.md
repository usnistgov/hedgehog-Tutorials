## Tutorials
Detailed explanations about the tutorials can be found in this [website](https://pages.nist.gov/hedgehog-Tutorials/). 

## Dependencies
- All tutorials depend on the [Hedgehog](https://github.com/usnistgov/hedgehog) library, location is specified by using: 
``` cmake
cmake -DHedgehog_INCLUDE_DIR=<dir>
```
The tutorials presented here need to be compiled with a C++ compiler compatible with C++20.

Libraries/tools:
- cmake 3.16+ is recommended for building the tutorials.
- Tutorial 4 requires [OpenBlas](http://www.openblas.net/).
- Tutorials 5 and 6 require [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
- Tutorial 7 requires gcc 12.1.0 + (Hedgehog static analysis requires a compiler with the constexpr std::vector (P1004R2) and constexpr std::string (P0980R1))

[TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/) is used and is embedded in the repository to parse the command-line of the
 different tutorials. 

## Getting started
```
1) From the hedgehog-Tutorials directory, create a build directory
2) From the build directory run, 'cmake -DHedgehog_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/hedgehog ../'
3) Run 'make'
```

The firsts tutorial are meant to demonstrate the usage of Hedgehog's API, and are not representative of gaining performance.
